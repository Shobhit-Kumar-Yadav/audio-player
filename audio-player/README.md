# React audioplayer
In this projects i use the context api to make an audio player with react
The app has a playlist, also a random selection of that playlist, and a repeat button also.
Here is a picture of the app:

# Instructions

Install all the packages first:  
`npm install`

To run the app:  
`npm start`  
This runs `react-scripts start`


Want to add things? Here is some ideas:  
I'll take PR for these
* Keyboard gestures, space for play/stop, arrows for volumen, etc.
* Favorite icon toggle / saving to local storage
* Songs dots options (three dots), add to playlist, see information of song, etc.
* Better responsive page, small displays, bellow 800vw
* Any improvement in the UI üòÅ
* Better random logic, don't repeat in the random cycle
